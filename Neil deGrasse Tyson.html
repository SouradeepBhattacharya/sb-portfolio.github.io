                <h2 class="left-aligned">About Neil deGrasse Tyson</h2>
                <p class="left-aligned">When Tyson was nine years old, his interest in astronomy was sparked by a trip to the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Tyson received a bachelor's degree in physics from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1980 and a master's degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin in 1983. 
                    He began writing a question-and-answer column for the University of Texas's popular astronomy magazine StarDate, and material from that column later appeared in his books Merlinâ€™s Tour of the Universe (1989) and Just Visiting This Planet (1998).
                    Tyson then earned a master's (1989) and a doctorate in astrophysics (1991) from Columbia University, New York City. 
                    He was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University from 1991 to 1994, when he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist. 
                    His research dealt with problems relating to galactic structure and evolution. 
                    He became acting director of the Hayden Planetarium in 1995 and director in 1996. From 1995 to 2005 he wrote monthly essays for Natural History magazine, some of which were collected in Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries (2007), and in 2000 he wrote an autobiography, The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist. 
                    His later books included Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (2017) and Letters from an Astrophysicist (2019).</p>
